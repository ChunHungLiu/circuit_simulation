Circuit simulation project

This project parses circuits (testbench.txt) and stores information in lists. From the lists  it composes matrixes and solves matrix systems Ax = B with diferrent methods.
C_sparse is a library of storing efficiently sparse matrixes, in order not to occupy large memory for large circuits with too few connections.

Therefore, in this project there is code for both c_sparse matrixes and ordinary matrixes, as well as solution of the system Ax = B for both of them.
